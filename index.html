        <h2>Fillerama.io Randomness</h2>
        <p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
        <p>And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to simply never stop learning, and progress my understanding of web design.  That is in part what draws me to web design, the never ending learning process.  Aside from that, I would perhaps some day like to learn the following languages as well!</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li><a href="http://w3schools.com/js/" target="_blank"><img src="images/icons/js.png" alt="JavaScript Icon"</li>
          <li><a href="https://python.org" target="_blank"><img src="images/icons/python.png" alt="Python Icon"></a></li>
          <li><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/icons/ruby-on-rails.png" alt="Ruby on Rails Icon"/></a></li>
          <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"><img src="images/icons/nodejs.png" alt="NodeJS Icon"/></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to make a career out of web development some day, perhaps as a full stack developer.</p>
